**Bellman Ford algorithm helps us find the shortest path from a vertex to all other vertices of a weighted graph.**


The Bellman-Ford algorithm provides the shortest distance from a prespecified origin node to all other nodes in the graph (weighted digraph). It is able to handle graphs where some of the edge weights are negative numbers. The based idea is: show if there is a negative cycle, generate a negative cycle and always find a negative cycle (if there is one) even if the graph is not connected.

Bellman Ford's Algorithm Applications
------------

1. For calculating shortest paths in routing algorithms
2. For finding the shortest path


How Bellman Ford's Algorithm Works
------------

Bellman Ford algorithm works by overestimating the length of the path from the starting vertex to all other vertices. Then it iteratively relaxes those estimates by finding new paths that are shorter than the previously overestimated paths.
By doing this repeatedly for all vertices, we can guarantee that the result is *optimized*.


Bellman Ford Pseudocode [`reference <https://www.programiz.com/dsa/bellman-ford-algorithm>`_]
------------
We need to maintain the path distance of every vertex. We can store that in an array of size v, where v is the number of vertices.

We also want to be able to get the shortest path, not only know the length of the shortest path. For this, we map each vertex to the vertex that last updated its path length.

Once the algorithm is over, we can backtrack from the destination vertex to the source vertex to find the path.

.. code-block::

      function bf_negative_cycle(G)
        for each vertex V in G
          distance[V] <- infinite
            previous[V] <- NULL
        distance[S] <- 0

        for each vertex V in G            
          for each edge (U,V) in G
            tempDistance <- distance[U] + edge_weight(U, V)
            if tempDistance < distance[V]
              distance[V] <- tempDistance
              previous[V] <- U

        for each edge (U,V) in G
          If distance[U] + edge_weight(U, V) < distance[V}
            Error: Negative Cycle Exists

        return distance[], previous[]


Function
------------

.. function:: bf_negative_cycle (graph)

   Returns an iterator that represents the shortest distance cycle in the graph. The input parameter must be the *negative logarithm* of the distance matrix as a DiGraph object, for example, `networkx <https://networkx.org/>`_.

      :graph: Negative logarithm of distances between nodes as a DiGraph object.

      #Bellman Ford Algorithm
      from bellman_ford import bf_negative_cycle
      #Digraph object
      import networkx as nx

      #Negative log matrix as graph
      G = nx.DiGraph()
      G.add_weighted_edges_from(edges)
